            <h2 >Cookie FAQs</h2>
            <div class="legal_text">
                <h3>Q. What is a cookie?</h3>
                <p>A. A cookie is a very tiny piece of text we're asking permission to place on your computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds the text in a small file. Its purpose is to help us distinguish you from the thousands of other customers that use our Web site each day.</p>
                <h3>Q. So why do you use cookies?</h3>
                <p>A. Cookies help us track visitors' use of our Web sites, such as what customers want to see and what they never read. That information allows us to better focus our sites, to concentrate on information people are reading and the products that interest them. We also use cookies to keep track of what products you have placed in your shopping cart as you move around our Web site. And if you decide to place an order with us and proceed through checkout, a cookie helps us step you through the checkout process.</p>
                <h3>Q. Can't cookies be used to invade my privacy?</h3>
                <p>A. We strongly believe in protecting the privacy and security of our customers. We never store any sensitive information in any cookie. The only information we store is a unique user ID - an alphanumeric string that contains no actual information about you. At no time do we store your e-mail address, physical address, credit card number, or name in any cookie. Likewise, we do not even store your credit card number within our internal Web site systems. We request that you supply us with your credit card number each time you wish to complete a transaction. While some Web sites store your card number for your convenience, we feel it provides you greater security to purge this information when each transaction is complete.</p>
                <h3>Q. Don't cookies take up a lot of my hard disk space?</h3>
                <p>A. A cookie is just a small text file, and takes up very little disk space. Cookies usually range in size from 60 to 300 bytes. Our cookies average about 100 bytes. Even if you surf the Internet very extensively and collect many cookies, they usually only occupy a very small fraction of your total available disk space. </p>
                <h3>Q. I still don't like the idea of cookies and I really don't want them. Now what?</h3>
                <p>A. We understand and respect your preferences. You can still take advantage of most of the features and benefits of our Web site. However, you will not be able to place items in your shopping cart, proceed through checkout and place an order. The good news is that we are still available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to assist you by telephone. One of our helpful Account Executives will be pleased to speak with you if you have any questions or wish to place an order.</p>

        <h3>How Lender Will Calculate the Balance: </h3>
        <p>Lender uses a method called "average daily balance (including new Purchases)." See the Account Agreement for more details.</p>
        <h3>*From time to time Lender may offer Standard Purchases or Promotional Purchases with a lower rate that may apply for a limited time.</h3>
        <h3>Amendment of the Terms and Conditions.</h3>
        <p>Lender may amend the Account Agreement, including any of the terms stated above, from time to time, in accordance with the paragraph of the Account Agreement called "Amendment of this Agreement."</p>
        <h3>Important information about procedures for opening a new account.</h3>
        <p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, Lender will obtain your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow Lender to identify you. Lender may verify this information with you or others. Lender may also request to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.</p>
        <h3>APPROVAL AND CREDIT LIMIT TERMS: </h3>
        <p>If you are under 21 years of age, we may require that you provide us additional information in compliance with the Credit CARD Act of 2009.</p>
        <h3>All accounts, including New York Residents:</h3>
        <p>You agree to give Lender permission to obtain a credit report from a consumer credit reporting agency in connection with this application, any transaction, or extension of credit, and on an ongoing basis, for the purpose of performing a routine and occasional verification of credit on your Account, adjusting the credit limit on your Account, taking collection action on your Account, or for any other legitimate purposes associated with your Account. Upon your request, you will be informed of whether or not a consumer credit report was ordered, and if it was, you will be given the name and address of the consumer reporting agency that furnished the report. New York residents may contact the New York State Department of Financial Services at 877-226-5697 or at 1 State Street, New York, NY 10004 to obtain a comparative listing of credit card rates, fees and grace periods.</p>
        <h3>Wisconsin Residents:</h3>
        <p>If you are married, by submitting your credit card application you are confirming that this credit card obligation is being incurred in the interest of your marriage and your family. No provision of any marital property agreement (pre-marital agreement), unilateral statement under 766.59 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or a court decree under 766.70 adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decrees or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify Lender if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you.</p>
        <h3>All accounts, including California and Utah Residents:</h3>
        <p>As required by law, you are hereby notified that a negative credit report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit obligations.</p>
        <p><span class="fBold">The Ohio laws against discrimination require that all creditors make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on each individual upon request. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers compliance with this law.</span></p>
        <p><span class="fBold">As required by California law, a married applicant may apply for a separate account.</span></p>
        <p><span class="fBold">Borrower may be liable for unauthorized use of the credit card. If the card is lost, stolen or if Borrower thinks someone may have used it without permission, Borrower must notify Lender in accordance with the Account Agreement. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.</span></p>

<li><span class="fBold">GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOUNT.</span> This is a multi-part open-end credit card account. You will request a Purchase on this Account by choosing the PCM Preferred Account payment option when you make a purchase from the Merchant.

    <p><span class="fBold">HOW YOU CAN USE THIS ACCOUNT. </span>The Merchant may allow you to charge the purchase to your Account if you provide the Merchant with proper credentials and certain information about your Account. You will not have to use the credit card or have it in your possession to make a purchase. We may refuse to make the extension of credit to you if the credit would cause the balances of the Account to exceed the Credit Limit.</p>

        <li><span style="font-style:italic">We may charge your Account for Purchases.</span> You authorize us to charge this Account for the Cost of any purchase you, or anyone to whom you have given permission to use this Account, make from the Merchant using this Account.

If you make a non-conforming payment, we may refuse to accept the payment. A non-conforming payment, if accepted by us, will be credited to your Account not more than 5 days after the date we receive it, unless otherwise required by law. A non-conforming payment includes, among other things, a payment that is not made in accordance with this paragraph and with the reasonable requirements set forth on the billing statement, oversized and undersized instruments, instruments using non-standard materials, instruments in a non-standard format, and any non-standard instrument that requires special handling.</li>
        <li>That when you make a payment on this Account by check, you authorize us to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your Account.

You may give us notice by telephone or in writing in accordance with the section of this Agreement called "Notices and Customer Service."</li>
        <li>If you are dissatisfied with goods or services you purchased from a Merchant, you will try in good faith to resolve the dispute and correct the problem directly with the Merchant. You agree to allow a reasonable period of time for the Merchant to resolve the dispute. This shall in no way limit or reduce your rights in case of a billing error.</li>
        <li>To use the Account for personal, family or household purposes only.</li>
        <li>To honor any other promises that you make in this Agreement.</li>

<li><span class="fBold">SECURITY INTEREST.</span>We will not take any security interest to secure this Account.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">INTEREST RATE AND INTEREST CHARGES.</span> Except during the term of an Interest-free Equal Payment Purchase prior to the End Date, Borrower agrees to pay interest on the outstanding balance of each part of this Account, including billed interest and billed fees, at all times that this Account is in effect, including any period after Termination in which there remains an outstanding balance. The interest will be calculated for each part of the Account separately, in the following way:
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
            <p><span class="fBold">Parts of the Account. </span>For the purposes of assessing interest, each part of the Account will be calculated separately. Parts may be called "Transaction Types" on the billing statements.</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">Standard Purchases. </span>All Standard Purchases and other balances that are moved to the Standard Purchases part of the Account will be a single part.</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">Promotional Purchases. </span>Promotional Purchases, while subject to different Promotional rates, terms, and Deferred Interest terms, will be different parts of the Account.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="fBold">Deferred Interest Purchases. </span>From time to time, we may offer Promotional Purchases with a Deferred Interest option. All purchases subject to the same rate, Deferred Interest terms and Expiration Date will be a single part; at our option, we may consider any Deferred Interest Purchase to be a separate part. If you pay the balance on the Deferred Interest part (which is called the "Deferred Interest Balance") in full by the Expiration Date, we will not charge any interest for that part. We will calculate the interest for each Billing Cycle prior to the Expiration Date and disclose it on the Billing Statement as the Accrued Deferred interest. If you do not pay the balance on a Deferred Interest part of the Account before the Expiration Date, we may charge your Account, in the Billing Cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs, interest on Promotional Purchase from the date of such Promotional Purchase (each "Transaction Date").</li>
                <li><span class="fBold">End of Promotional Terms. </span>If a part is subject to a special promotional rate or Deferred Interest term which ends as of a certain date ("Expiration Date"), you authorize us to move, on or after that date, the balance remaining in that part to the Standard Purchases part of the Account, and it will be subject to the repayment and interest terms for Standard Purchases.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">When the Interest begins. </span>The interest begins to accrue on the transaction date, except (i) interest does not accrue on any portion of a Purchase that you repay during the Grace Period for the Purchase, if a Grace Period is applicable to the Purchase; (ii) interest will not be assessed if the conditions in the following paragraph are met, and (iii) interest does not accrue prior to the End Date on an Interest-free Equal Payment Purchase.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Assessing Interest. </span>We will not assess interest on Standard or Promotional Purchases during any Billing Cycle in which your payments and credits on or before the Payment Due Date reduce the outstanding balance for Standard and Promotional Purchases (excluding Standard and Promotional Purchases you made during the Billing Cycle, and excluding Deferred Interest Purchases) to zero or to a credit balance.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Grace Period. </span>Only Standard Purchases and Promotional Purchases (other than a Deferred Interest Purchase) are eligible for a Grace Period. If a Purchase which is eligible for a Grace Period is made during a Billing Cycle in which no interest was assessed on the Account because of the preceding paragraph, we will not assess interest on any portion of the Purchase which you repay on or before the Payment Due Date in the next cycle.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">How we will determine the balance on which the Interest is computed. </span>We will compute the interest for each part on the "Average Daily Balance" (including new purchases) for that part during the Billing Cycle. To get the Average Daily Balance for each part, we will take the beginning balance for each part each day and add any new Purchases and adjustments posted that day, including billed Interest and billed Fees; then subtract any payments and any credits. This gives us the "Daily Balance." Then, we add up all the Daily Balances for the Billing Cycle for that part and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. The result is the Average Daily Balance for that part. We will treat any Daily Balance which is a credit balance as zero.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">How we compute the Interest. </span>We will compute the interest during the Billing Cycle for each part separately. For each part, we will multiply the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle by the number of days in the Billing Cycle; then we will multiply the product by the Daily Periodic Rate in effect for that part during that Billing Cycle. The result is the interest for that part. We will then add up the interest for all the parts, to get the interest for the Account.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Minimum Interest Charge. </span>If the Daily Balance of any part (excluding any balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, prior to its Expiration Date, and any Interest-free Equal Payment Purchase part), on the last day of a Billing Cycle (the Statement Date), is greater than zero, and if the interest for the Billing Cycle is greater than zero but less than $2.00, we may assess a Minimum Interest Charge (which will be shown on the billing statement as a fee called a "Minimum Interest Charge") of $2.00 for the Billing Cycle.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Rate of Interest. </span>We will compute the interest on the Standard, Promotional and Financed Equal Payment Purchases parts using the Daily Periodic Rate of 0.07121%. This corresponds to the <span class="fBold">ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 25.99%</span>. However, if we have disclosed a special promotional rate at the time we made the special offer, we will compute the interest on the Promotional Purchases parts using that special promotional rate.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">FEES. </span>You agree to pay the following Fees, as applicable. You agree that we may allocate any Fees to the Standard Purchases part of the Account.
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
            <p><span class="fBold">Late Payment Fee. </span>We will charge you a Late Fee for each month the Minimum Payment is not paid in full by its Payment Due Date. The amount of the Late Fee will be the amount of the missed payment, up to (1) $5 if the Minimum Payment Due is less than $25, or (2) $25 if the Minimum Payment Due is $25 or more, the first time you are late, and, if your payment is late again within the next six billing cycles after any prior late payment, up to $35. No Late Fee will be due if the reason the Payment is late is either:</p>
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>attributable to a Late Fee assessed on an earlier payment; or</li>
                <li>because, after default, the entire balance on this Account is due.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="fBold">(ii) Return Check Fee. </span>If your payment on this Account is made with a check, including a draft, order or other instrument that is returned by drawee for "not sufficient funds" in the account on which the check is written, or for other reasons such as a closed account, we will charge you a Fee equal to the amount of the required Minimum Payment Due immediately prior to the date on which the payment is returned, up to $25. We will not charge the service charge, however, if we redeposit the check and it is paid.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><span class="fBold">Fee for providing a copy of billing statement. </span>Unless we are required by law to provide you with a copy of a billing statement for a Billing Cycle other than the current Billing Cycle, you agree to pay us a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) per billing statement if you request a copy.</p></li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE. </span>The Minimum Payment Due will be due each Billing Cycle, on or before the Payment Due Date. The amount of the Minimum Payment Due will be the sum of the Monthly Plan Payments due on each Equal Payment Purchase Part plus the payment due for the revolving parts plus any amounts past due from previous Billing Cycles.
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><span class="fBold">Revolving Parts. </span>Revolving Parts. The current payment due will be the greatest of: (A) $25, or $35.00 if you failed to pay at least the total Minimum Payment Due by the due date in any one or more of the prior six (6) billing cycles; or (B) 3% of the sum of the balances on the revolving parts (excluding any balance on a no payments for 6 months (or 9 months or 12 months, as applicable) purchase prior to its Expiration Date), on the last day of the Billing Cycle; or (C) 1% of the sum of the balances on the revolving parts (excluding any balance on a no payments for 6 months (or 9 months or 12 months, as applicable) purchase prior to its Expiration Date), on the last day of the Billing Cycle plus any interest assessed on the Account in that billing cycle (excluding any accrued interest on a Deferred Interest Purchase that has been billed in that billing cycle), plus any Late Fees and Other Fees assessed on the Account in that billing cycle. The payment will be rounded down to the next whole dollar.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Equal Payment Parts. </span>The Monthly Plan Payment due for each Equal Payment Purchase which has not reached its End Date and on which a balance is outstanding will be the equal payment amount you agree to when you make an Equal Payment Purchase. The Monthly Plan Payments for an Equal Payment Purchase will be calculated so that they are substantially equal over the term of the Equal Payment Purchase. In no event, however, will the Monthly Plan Payment due for any Equal Payment Purchase be greater than the outstanding balance due on that part of the Account. The Monthly Plan Payment due on the End Date may be more or less than the others, because it will be adjusted as necessary to pay the actual balance and accrued interest owing on the End Date.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">PAYMENT APPLICATION.</span> We will use each payment in the amount of the Minimum Payment Due or less, first to pay billed Monthly Plan Payments on the Equal Payment Purchases (in any order we choose), then billed interest, then billed Fees, then the principal balance of the revolving parts (in any order we choose), and then any other amounts due. However, if you have a balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, during the two Billing Cycles immediately preceding the Expiration Date, we may use the payment first to pay billed Monthly Plan Payments on any Equal Payment Purchases (in any order we choose) and then to pay the balance on any Deferred Interest Purchases, (in any order we choose).</li>
<li><span class="fBold">PREPAYMENT.</span> If you pay an amount greater than the Minimum Payment Due in any Billing Cycle, the amount in excess of the Minimum Payment Due is a "prepayment." A prepayment does not change your obligation to make the Minimum Payment Due the next billing cycle. <span class="fBold">YOU MAY MAKE PREPAYMENTS IN ANY AMOUNT AND MAY PAY THE ENTIRE BALANCE OR ANY PART OF IT AT ANY TIME PROVIDED THAT YOU PAY AT LEAST THE MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE IN EACH BILLING CYCLE WHEN IT IS DUE.</span> If you make a prepayment, we will use the prepayment to pay the balances starting with the balance with the highest interest rate (in any order we choose), then the balances with the next highest interest rate (in any order we choose), and so forth. However, if you have a balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, and you make a prepayment during the two Billing Cycles immediately preceding the Expiration Date, we will use the prepayment first to pay the balance on the Deferred Interest Purchase, starting with the balance subject to the highest interest rate. We may choose to apply prepayments to the Deferred Interest Balance before other balances.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">BILLING STATEMENTS AND CREDIT BALANCES.</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
            <p>We will provide you with a billing statement for each Billing Cycle in which:</p>
            <p><span class="fBold"> </span> We impose interest to this Account; or</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(ii)</span> The New Balance is more than $1.00 (whether a credit or debit balance).</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(iii)</span> You understand that we may provide you with electronic billing statements only and that you can elect to receive paper statements by logging in to <a href="https://www.pcm.mypreferredaccount.com" target="_blank">www.pcm.mypreferredaccount.com</a> .</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(iv)</span> You agree to notify us in writing of any errors in the billing statement within 60 days from the date it is provided. You agree to examine the billing statement and to notify us in writing, immediately, of any Purchases which were not made or authorized by you. We need not provide a billing statement to you if we deem this Account uncollectible or if delinquency collection proceedings have been started.</p>
        </li>
        <li> If the Account has a credit balance in excess of $1.00, we will refund the credit balance to you as required by law. You authorize us to make the refund electronically or using an ACH, (i) if you made the payment which caused the credit balance electronically or using an ACH, or (ii) if you typically make payments on this Account electronically or using an ACH.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">DEFAULT. </span>You will be in default if any of the following happen:
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If you fail to pay any Minimum Payment Due on or before the Payment Due Date.</li>
        <li>If you fail to keep any promise or perform any duty in this Agreement, or in any other agreement with us. If default occurs, we may have no duty to make advances from this Account and this Account will be terminated. This may happen without any prior notice to you. If we choose, at our sole option, to make new extensions of credit from this Account after default, you agree that we may charge those extensions of credit to this Account. In addition, if a default occurs, all amounts which you owe under this Agreement shall be due and payable immediately, at our option (subject to any applicable law to the contrary). The other provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply to this Account. If we get a judgment after default and/or if you are a debtor in an action filed by or against you under the Bankruptcy Code, unless prohibited by applicable law, the rates of interest applicable to this Account will continue to apply to the balances on this Account. A default under this Agreement may be deemed by us to be a default under any other account which you have with us.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">TERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNT.</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>In addition to Termination by default, we may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason subject to the requirements of applicable law. For example, we may terminate because the business relationship with the Merchant may end.</li>
        <li>You can terminate your Account by sending written notice to the address on the billing statement.</li>
        <li>If there is no debit or credit on this Account for twelve (12) consecutive months, we may terminate this Account without notice to you.</li>
        <li>After Termination, you will not be able to make new purchases on this Account. Termination will not affect any purchase which complies with this Agreement and which was made before the date of the Termination notice. If we choose, at our sole option, to allow purchases after we have terminated this Account (whether or not you have given us notice to terminate this Account), you agree that we may charge those purchases to this Account. After Termination under this paragraph, balances will continue to accrue interest until paid in full and you agree to pay the balance on this Account, the interest and all other amounts due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All other provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">OUR LIABILITY.</span> We have no responsibility for the failure of the Merchant to accept payment using this Account. Our liability, if liability is provided under applicable law, for a wrongful failure to extend credit on this Account is limited to your actual damages. Failure to extend credit for any reason as provided under the terms of this Agreement will not be wrongful.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. </span>We may amend this Agreement from time to time, in any respect by giving you written notice where required by law. An amendment may change something in this Agreement (for example, the rate of interest on any or all the parts), add something new or take something out. Such amendments will apply to outstanding balances and new Purchases, except (i) an increase in the APR will apply to new Purchases made more than 14 days after written notice is mailed, (ii) as otherwise indicated in the written notice or (iii) as otherwise provided by applicable law. This Agreement, except when amended in accordance with this Agreement, is the final expression of the Agreement between us and may not be contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.</span> Our remedies under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not alternative.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">DELAY IN ENFORCEMENT. </span>We can delay enforcing any of our rights under this Agreement without losing them. Any waiver by us of any provision of this Agreement will not be a waiver of the same or any other provision on any other occasion.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">BOOK ENTRY SYSTEM. </span>You hereby appoint Bill Me Later, Inc. as your agent in maintaining, and Bill Me Later, Inc. agrees to maintain, a book entry system that records the identity of the owner of each Purchase on the Account. The right to the principal of, and stated interest on, each Purchase on the Account may only be transferred through the book entry system maintained by Bill Me Later, Inc. This section does not affect any of Borrower's obligations under this Agreement. This section does not limit or waive any of Borrower's rights, including but not limited to Borrower's Billing Rights.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">ASSIGNMENT. </span>You may not assign or otherwise transfer your rights and privileges under this Agreement, or delegate your obligations to repay amounts you owe. Any attempt by you to assign or delegate will be void and of no effect. We may assign any and all of our rights under this Agreement at any time without your consent. Any person, company or bank to which we assign this Agreement shall be entitled to all of our rights under this Agreement. None of your rights or obligations shall be affected by such assignment.</li>

<li><span class="fBold">GOVERNING LAW, FORUM.</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><span class="fBold">Governing Law.</span> This Agreement has been accepted by us in the state of Utah, and all extensions of credit will be made by us in the state of Utah. Regardless of the state of your residence or the place where the Merchant is located, you agree that the provisions of this Agreement relating to interest, charges and fees shall be governed by federal law and construed in accordance with federal law and, as made applicable by federal law, the law of the state of Utah. Other terms and provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the state of Utah, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except to the extent preempted, superseded, or supplemented by federal law.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Forum for Disputes.</span> Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate in Section 27 below is found not to apply to you or to a dispute either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or by court order, you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against us must be resolved by a court located in Utah. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Utah for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. Please read this provision carefully. It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how legal claims you and we have against each other are resolved if you do not opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><span class="fBold">Summary.</span> Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling us at (866) 528-3733. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve any Claims (as defined below) you may have to your satisfaction (or if we have not been able to resolve a Claim we have with you after attempting to do so) after following the procedures set forth in this provision, we and you each agree to resolve those Claims through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. <span class="fBold">Any arbitration under this Agreement to Arbitrate will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and non-individualized injunctive relief are not permitted. By agreeing to arbitrate, both parties are waiving the right to a trial by jury or before a judge.</span> For any non-frivolous Claim with a value of $75,000 or less, we will pay all of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees charged by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") in connection with the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration, you are entitled to recover attorney's fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court.</li>
        <li>Claims Subject to Arbitration. We and you (including users, custodians, and beneficiaries of your Account) agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims between you and us ("Claims"), including claims involving Bill Me Later, Inc. and its or the Lender's agents, employees, officers, directors, predecessors in interest, and successors and assigns. This Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. Claims include, but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>claims or disputes arising out of or relating to your Account, the Account Agreement, or any transactions involving your Account or the Account Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;</li>
                <li>claims or disputes that arose before the effective date of the Account Agreement or any prior Account Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising, promotions, or disclosures); and</li>
                <li>claims or disputes that may arise after the termination of the Agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            The Account Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et. seq., governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate. The Agreement to Arbitrate shall survive the closing of your Account and/or the termination of the Account Agreement.
        </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Notice of Dispute. </span>
            A party who intends to pursue a Claim must first send to the other a letter describing the Claim (a "Notice of Dispute"). Any Notice of Dispute sent to the Lender and/or Bill Me Later, Inc. should be addressed to:<br>
            PCM Preferred Account, c/o Bill Me Later, Inc.<br>
            9690 Deereco Road, Suite 110<br>
            Timonium, Maryland 21093<br>
            ATTN: Legal Department<br><br>
            Any Notice of Dispute sent to you by us shall be sent to the address in the Lender's records that is associated with your Account at the time the Notice of Dispute is sent. The Notice of Dispute must (a) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; (b) set forth the specific relief sought; (c) set forth the name and address of the claimant; and (d) include the Account number to which the Claim relates. If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim described in the Notice of Dispute within 45 days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or, if the AAA is unavailable, such other arbitration provider to which the parties agree or the court selects. Neither you nor we shall disclose to the arbitrator the existence, amount, or terms of any settlement offers made by any party until after the arbitrator issues a final award resolving the Claim.<br><br>
            A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's web site at http:/www.adr.org. If you or we attempt to commence arbitration proceedings before providing the requisite Notice of Dispute, the AAA shall not commence administration of arbitration proceedings for at least 45 days after the AAA receives the request to initiate arbitration.
        </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Costs of Arbitration. </span>Except as otherwise provided herein, we will pay all of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees charged by the AAA for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in your Claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously paid by us, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you or we initiate an arbitration proceeding in which the value of the relief sought (either to you or to us) is greater than $75,000, the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
            <br><br>
            After we receive notice that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless the value of the relief sought is greater than $75,000. The maximum filing fee to be paid by you is currently $125 for Claims up to $10,000 and $375 for Claims over $10,000 and up to $75,000. However, these fees are subject to change at the discretion of the AAA. If you are unable to pay your share of the filing fee, we will pay it directly to the AAA upon receiving a written request from you at the notice address provided above.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Arbitration Procedures.</span>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the notice address provided above.
            <br><br>
            The arbitrator is bound by the terms of the Account Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the arbitrability of Claims or the scope and enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, including the interpretation of Section 27(f) below, are for the court to decide. If the value (either to you or us) of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. Otherwise, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any in-person arbitration hearing will take place within the federal judicial district where the address associated with your Account as identified in the Lender's records at the time the arbitration is commenced is located or, if that location is inconvenient to you, at some other location that the parties agree is convenient.
            <br><br>
            The arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with all applicable law, including recognized principles of equity and statutes of limitations, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. Under this Agreement to Arbitrate, arbitrators shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different customers, but are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same customer to the extent required by applicable law.
            <br><br>
            Unless the parties agree otherwise, you or we, as applicable, must bring all related or similar Claims in a single arbitration proceeding. If you or we later initiate a subsequent arbitration asserting Claims that are related or similar to ones that were raised in a prior arbitration between the same parties, the AAA or the arbitrator shall either: (i) consolidate the subsequent arbitration with the earlier proceeding if it is ongoing or (ii) dismiss the Claims raised in the subsequent arbitration that would be barred by applicable law if brought in court.
            <br><br>
            Upon the request of either party made prior to the closing of the hearing (or, if there is no oral hearing, prior to or along with submission of final documents to the AAA), the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award, if any, is based. Unless the parties agree otherwise, any award shall be rendered by the arbitrator not later than 14 days from the date of the closing of the hearing or, if there is no oral hearing, from the date of the AAA's transmittal of the final statements and proofs to the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</span> The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual Claim; any declaratory or injunctive relief must be individualized in nature and cannot affect other Account holders. <span class="fBold">YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC.</span> Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than this prohibition of class or representative actions and/or consolidation) is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. However, if a court decides that this paragraph's prohibition of class or representative actions and/or consolidation is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Availability of Small Claims Court and Access to Government Agencies. </span>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we or you may bring an individual action in small claims court. This Agreement to Arbitrate does not preclude us or you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Opt-Out Procedure.</span> You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate ("opt-out") by mailing us a written opt-out notice. The written opt-out notice must state that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate and must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date that you agree to the Account Agreement for the first time. The opt-out notice must include your name, address, and Account number(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the written opt-out notice for it to be effective. Mail the opt-out notice to:

Moreover, if we seek to terminate the Agreement to Arbitrate as included in the Account Agreement, any such termination shall not be effective until at least 30 days after written notice of such termination is provided to you, and shall not be effective as to Claims which arose prior to the date of termination.</li>

    <p><span class="fBold">BORROWER'S BILLING RIGHTS - KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE.</span></p>
    <p>This notice is required by federal law. In this notice, "you" and "your" mean the Borrower. "We" and "our" mean the Lender. This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.</p>
    <p><span class="fBold">What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement</span></p>
    <p>If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:</p>
    <p>PCM Preferred Account, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094.</p>
    <p>In your letter, give us the following information:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">Account information: </span>Your name and account number.</li>
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">Dollar amount: </span>The dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">Description of problem: </span>If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You must contact us:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.</li>
        <li>At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us or email us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.</p>
    <p>What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter</p>
    <p>When we receive your letter, we must do two things:</p>
    <p>1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.</p>
    <p>2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
        While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.</li>
        <li>The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.</li>
        <li>While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.</li>
        <li>We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">If we made a mistake:</span> You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.</li>
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">If we do not believe there was a mistake:</span> You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.</p>
    <p>If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.</p>
    <p>Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases</p>
    <p>If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.</p>
    <p>To use this right, all of the following must be true:</p>
    <p>1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)</p>
    <p>2. You must have used your credit card for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.</p>
    <p>3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase.</p>
    <p>If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at:</p>
    <p>PCM Preferred Account, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094</p>
    <p>While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.</p>

When you visit the www.pcm.mypreferredaccount.com website or use Preferred Account Services, we also collect information about your transactions and your activities.</p>
        <p>In addition, if you open a Preferred Account or use Preferred Account Services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed personal information such as your date of birth or social security number.</li>
            <li>Contact information, such as your name, address, phone, email, and other similar information. Information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services.</li>
            <li>Financial information, such as the full bank account numbers and/or credit card numbers that you link to your Preferred Account or give us when you use Preferred Account Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). The information we may receive varies by site and is controlled by that site. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Preferred Account and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>In order to help protect you from fraud and misuse of your personal information, we may collect information about your use and interaction with our website or Preferred Account Services. For example, we may evaluate your computer, mobile phone or other access device to identify any malicious software or activity.</p>
        <p>We may also collect additional information from or about you in other ways, such as through contact with our customer support team or results when you respond to a survey and from interactions with certain third parties that we share information with in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p><span class="fBold">How we use Cookies</span></p>
        <p>When you access our website or use Preferred Account Services, we (including companies we work with) may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, &quot;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Flash cookies</a>,&quot; or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (&quot;Cookies&quot;).

Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling Cookies.</p>
        <p>You may encounter Preferred Account Cookies on websites that we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a Cookie placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third parties may place their own Cookies that are not subject to our control and the Preferred Account Privacy Policy does not cover their use.</p>

        <p><span class="fBold">How we protect and store personal information</span></p>
        <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term &quot;personal information&quot; to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person.

        <p>We store and process your personal information on our computers. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <p><span class="fBold">Billing Rights:</span> Information on Borrower's rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in the Account Agreement.</p>
        <h3>*From time to time, Lender may offer Standard Purchases or Promotional Purchases with a lower rate that may apply for a limited time.</h3>
        <h3>**From time to time, Lender may waive the Installment Purchase Transaction Fee in connection with an Installment Purchase promotional offer.</h3>
        <p><span class="fBold">Amendment of the Terms and Conditions.</span> Lender may amend the Account Agreement, including any of the terms stated above, from time to time, in accordance with the paragraph of the Account Agreement called "Amendment of this Agreement." </p>

        <p><span class="fBold">Important information about procedures for opening a new account.</span> To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, Lender will obtain your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow Lender to identify you. Lender may verify this information with you and others. Lender may also request to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. </p>

        <p><span class="fBold">APPROVAL AND CREDIT LIMIT TERMS:</span> If you are under 21 years of age, we may require that you provide us additional information in compliance with the Credit CARD Act of 2009. </p>

        <p><span class="fBold">All accounts, including New York Residents:</span> You agree to give Lender permission to obtain a credit report from a consumer credit reporting agency in connection with this application, any transaction, or extension of credit, and on an ongoing basis, for the purpose of performing a routine and occasional verification of credit on your Account, adjusting the credit limit on your Account, taking collection action on your Account, or for any other legitimate purposes associated with your Account. Upon your request, you will be informed of whether or not a consumer credit report was ordered, and if it was, you will be given the name and address of the consumer reporting agency that furnished the report. New York residents may contact the New York State Department of Financial Services at 877-226-5697 or at 1 State Street, New York, NY 10004 to obtain a comparative listing of credit card rates, fees and grace periods. </p>

        <p><span class="fBold">Wisconsin Residents:</span> If you are married, by submitting your credit card application you are confirming that this credit card obligation is being incurred in the interest of your marriage and your family. No provision of any marital property agreement (pre-marital agreement), unilateral statement under 766.59 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or a court decree under 766.70 adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decrees or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision. If the credit card for which you are applying is granted, you will notify Lender if you have a spouse who needs to receive notification that credit has been extended to you. </p>

        <p><span class="fBold">All accounts, including California and Utah Residents:</span> As required by law, you are hereby notified that a negative credit report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit obligations. </p>

        <p><span class="fBold">The Ohio laws against discrimination require that all creditors make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on each individual upon request.

        <li><span class="fBold">Installment Purchases.</span> We may offer you the opportunity to make purchases from some Merchants as Installment Purchases. We may offer this as the only method you can use to make a purchase from a Merchant, or as an option to the Standard Purchase method. We will extend credit to you, in the amount of the Cost of the Purchase, by paying the Merchant on your behalf. Installment Purchases will be subject to Financed Installment Purchase terms, unless otherwise agreed.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Refinance of Closed-end Loan.</span> If you have any unpaid Closed-end Loans from us at the time you open this Account, you request that we refinance the Closed-end Loans by extending credit from this Account. If a Closed-end loan is subject to a Promotional rate or a Deferred Interest provision, the extension of credit will be from an equivalent Promotional or Deferred Interest part of the Account. If the Closed-end Loan is not subject to a Promotional rate or a Deferred Interest provision, the extension of credit will be from the Standard Purchases part of the Account.</li>
        <li><p><span class="fBold">Other Agreements about Purchases and Cash Advances.</span></p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(i) Credit Line.</span> At the time you open your Account and obtain your first extension of credit, we will evaluate your request for credit. If we extend you credit, we will disclose to you the total amount of your Credit Line, which will be no less than $250 ("minimum Credit Line").
                If you try to make a Purchase or request a Cash Advance that would cause your outstanding balance to be above your Credit Line, we will treat that as a request to increase the Credit Line.
                For example:</p>								<ul>
                <li>If your Credit Line is $650, you have a $200 balance, and you try to make a Purchase or request a Cash Advance of $500, we will treat this as a request for an increase in the Credit Line. If we approve this transaction, your new Credit Line will be $700 (the "highest balance").</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have the option to refuse a request for an increase, but we will notify you of the reasons for any refusal. We may occasionally and routinely verify credit information about you and obtain an updated consumer report in connection with this Account. We may decrease your Credit Line at any time. We will notify you at the time we do so. From time to time, we may review your Account to ensure that payments and transactions posting to your Account are valid and not fraudulent and that good funds are collected for payments. In doing so, we may temporarily limit your ability to utilize the total credit available to borrow until the Account review is completed and/or transactions and payments are confirmed to be valid and fully collected. </p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(ii) We may charge your Account for Purchases and Cash Advances.</span> You authorize us to charge this Account for the Cost of any Purchase or Cash Advance you, or anyone to whom you have given permission to use this Account, make from a Merchant using Bill Me Later. You understand that the amount that we actually pay to the Merchant for any Purchase or that PayPal, Inc. pays to any recipient of a Cash Advance may be less than the Cost of the Purchase or Cash Advance, because: (i) the Merchant may agree that we or a third party may retain a portion of the Cost in order to participate in Bill Me Later, or (ii) PayPal, Inc. may charge you fees for facilitating a Send Money transaction, which may be equal to the total of: (1) a percentage of the Cash Advance extended in connection with the Send Money transaction, plus (2) a transaction fee.</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(iii) We may charge your Account for Interest and Fees.</span> You authorize us to charge this Account for interest, any Fees, costs of collection, and amounts that you agree in this Agreement to pay.</p>

You authorize the Merchant to share your email address with us.</li>

<li><span class="fBold">PROMISE TO PAY. </span>Borrower promises to pay to us the balance on this Account, including all Purchases and Cash Advances, extensions of credit and other amounts Borrower has authorized us to charge to this Account. Borrower promises to pay these amounts as agreed in this Agreement, including the promise to make the Minimum Payment Due each month on or before the Payment Due Date.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">BORROWER ALSO PROMISES:</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>To pay for all Purchases made by you and by someone you authorized to use this Account. We (and any person who may decide whether you are liable for amounts charged to this Account) may presume that you have authorized any Purchase made in your name using this Account, if the purchase is delivered in your name to your address, unless you return the Purchase to the Merchant within a reasonable period of time. You will not be responsible for any unauthorized Purchases using this Account.</li>
        <li>To pay for all Cash Advances made by you and by someone you authorized to use this Account. You will not be responsible for any unauthorized Cash Advances using this Account.</li>

        <li>Not to give us false information or signatures, electronic or otherwise, at any time.</li>

If you make a non-conforming payment, we may refuse to accept the payment. A non-conforming payment, if accepted by us, will be credited to your Account not more than 5 days after the date we receive it, unless otherwise required by law. A non-conforming payment includes, among other things, a payment that is not made in accordance with this paragraph and with the reasonable requirements set forth on the billing statement, oversized and undersized instruments, instruments using non-standard materials, instruments in a non-standard format, and any non-standard instrument that requires special handling.</li>
        <li>That when you make a payment on this Account by check, you authorize us to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account. In certain circumstances, such as for technical or processing reasons, we may process your payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you understand that you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. You have the right to withdraw this authorization at any time by informing us that you do not want us to use the information from your checks to make an electronic fund transfer; to do so, you must contact us in writing at Electronic Check Opt Out, P.O. Box 4415, Timonium, MD 21094 and provide us with your name, Bill Me Later Account number and the name of the financial institution and account number from which your checks are drawn.</li>

        <li>To use Bill Me Later only for personal, family or household purposes.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">SECURITY INTEREST. </span>We will not take any security interest to secure this Account.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">INTEREST RATE AND INTEREST CHARGES.</span> Borrower agrees to pay interest on the outstanding balance of each part of this Account, including billed interest and billed Fees, at all times that this Account is in effect, including any period after Termination in which there remains an outstanding balance. For the purposes of assessing interest, each part of the Account, which may be called "Transaction Types" on the billing statements, will be calculated separately, in the following way:
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
            <p><span class="fBold">Parts of the Account. </span></p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(i) Standard Purchases.</span> All Standard Purchases and any other balances that are moved to the Standard Purchases part of the Account will be a single part.</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(ii) Promotional Purchases.</span> Promotional Purchases, while subject to different Promotional rates, terms, and Deferred Interest terms, will be different parts of the Account.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="fBold">Deferred Interest Purchases.</span> From time to time, we may offer Promotional Purchases with a Deferred Interest option. All Purchases subject to the same rate, Deferred Interest terms and Expiration Date will be a single part; at our option, we may consider any Deferred Interest Purchase to be a separate part, or may consider Deferred Interest Purchases from different Merchants to be different parts. If you pay the balance on the Deferred Interest part (which is called the "Deferred Interest Balance") in full by the Expiration Date, we will not charge any interest for that part. We will calculate the interest for each Billing Cycle prior to the Expiration Date and disclose it on the Billing Statement as the Accrued Deferred Interest. If you do not pay the balance on a Deferred Interest part of the Account before the Expiration Date, we may charge your Account, in the Billing Cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs, interest on each Promotional Purchase from the date of the Purchase (each "transaction date").</li>
                <li><span class="fBold">End of Promotional Terms.</span> If a part is subject to a special promotional rate or Deferred Interest term which ends as of a certain date ("Expiration Date"), you authorize us to move, on or after that date, the balance remaining in that part to the Standard Purchases part of the Account, and it will be subject to the repayment and interest terms for Standard Purchases.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(iii) Cash Advances.</span> All Cash Advances will be a single part of the Account.</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(iv) Installment Purchases.</span> Each Installment Purchase will be a part of the Account. If there is a balance owing on an Interest-free Installment Purchase after the End Date, I authorize you to move, on or after the End Date, that balance to the Standard Purchases part of the Account, and it will be subject to the repayment and interest terms for Standard Purchases.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">When the Interest begins.</span> The interest begins to accrue on the transaction date, except (i) interest does not accrue on any portion of a Purchase or Cash Advance that you repay during the Grace Period for the Purchase or Cash Advance, if a Grace Period is applicable to the Purchase or Cash Advance; (ii) interest will not be assessed if the conditions in the following paragraph are met; and (iii) interest does not accrue prior to the End Date on an Interest-free Installment Purchase.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Assessing Interest.</span> We will not assess interest on Standard or Promotional Purchases or Cash Advances during any Billing Cycle in which your payments and credits on or before the Payment Due Date reduce the outstanding balance for Standard and Promotional Purchases (excluding Standard and Promotional Purchases you made during the Billing Cycle, and excluding Deferred Interest Purchases or Interest-free Installment Purchases) or Cash Advance to zero or to a credit balance.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Grace Period.</span> Only Standard Purchases and Promotional Purchases (other than a Deferred Interest Purchase) and Cash Advances are eligible for a Grace Period. If a Purchase or Cash Advance that is eligible for a Grace Period is made during a Billing Cycle in which no interest was assessed on the Purchase or Cash Advance because of the preceding paragraph, we will not assess interest on any portion of the Purchase or Cash Advance which you repay on or before the Payment Due Date in the next cycle. </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">How we will determine the balance on which the interest is computed.</span> We will compute the interest for each part on the "Average Daily Balance" (including new Purchases and Cash Advances) for that part during the Billing Cycle. To get the Average Daily Balance for each part, we will take the beginning balance for each part each day and add any new Purchases, Cash Advances and adjustments posted that day, including billed interest and billed Fees; then subtract any payments and any credits. This gives us the "Daily Balance." Then, we add up all the Daily Balances for the Billing Cycle for that part and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. The result is the Average Daily Balance for that part. We will treat any Daily Balance which is a credit balance as zero. </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">How we compute the Interest.</span> We will compute the interest during the Billing Cycle for each part separately. For each part, we will multiply the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle by the number of days in the Billing Cycle; then we will multiply the product by the Daily Periodic Rate in effect for that part during that Billing Cycle. The result is the interest for that part. We will then add up the interest for all the parts, to get the interest for the Account.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Minimum Interest Charge.</span> If the Daily Balance of any part (excluding any balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, prior to its Expiration Date, and any Interest-free Installment Purchase part), on the last day of a Billing Cycle (the Statement Date), is greater than zero, and if the interest for the Billing Cycle is greater than zero but less than $2.00, we may assess a Minimum Interest Charge (which will be shown on the billing statement as a fee called a "Minimum Interest Charge") of $2.00 for the Billing Cycle.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Rate of Interest.</span> We will compute the interest on the Standard, Promotional and Financed Installment Purchases, as well as Cash Advance parts using the Daily Periodic Rate of 0.05477%. This corresponds to the <span class="fBold">ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 19.99%.</span> However, if we have disclosed a special promotional rate at the time we made the special offer, we will compute the interest on the Promotional Purchases parts using that special promotional rate.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">FEES. </span>You agree to pay the following Fees, as applicable. You agree that we may allocate any Fee to the Standard Purchases and/or Cash Advances part of the Account.
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><span class="fBold">Penalty Fees.</span></p>
            <p><span class="fBold">Transaction Fees.</span></p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(i) Installment Purchase Transaction Fee.</span> We may charge you an Installment Purchase Transaction Fee each time you make a Purchase using the Installment Purchase part of the Account. The amount of the Installment Purchase Transaction Fee, if any, will be equal to 2% of the total amount of each Installment Purchase.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class="fBold">(i) Late Payment Fee.</span>We will charge you a Late Fee for each month the Minimum Payment is not paid in full by its Payment Due Date. The amount of the Late Fee will be the amount of the missed payment, up to (1) $5 if the Minimum Payment Due is less than $25, or (2) $25 if the Minimum Payment Due is $25 or more, the first time you are late, and, if your payment is late again within the next six billing cycles after any prior late payment, up to $35. No Late Fee will be due if the reason the Payment is late is either:</p>
            <ol class="alpha">
                <li>attributable to a Late Fee assessed on an earlier payment; or</li>
                <li>because, after default, the entire balance on this Account is due.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="fBold">(ii) Return Check Fee.</span> If your payment on this Account is made with a check, including a draft, order or other instrument that is returned by a drawee for "not sufficient funds" in the account on which the check is written, or for other reasons such as a closed account, we will charge you a Fee equal to the amount of the required Minimum Payment Due immediately prior to the date on which the payment is returned, up to $25. We will not charge the service charge, however, if we redeposit the check and it is paid.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Fee for providing a copy of billing statement.</span>Fee for providing a copy of billing statement. Unless we are required by law to provide you with a copy of a billing statement for a Billing Cycle other than the current Billing Cycle, you agree to pay us a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) per billing statement if you request a copy.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE.</span> The Minimum Payment Due will be due each Billing Cycle, on or before the Payment Due Date. The amount of the Minimum Payment Due will be the sum of the Monthly Plan Payments due on each Installment Purchase part plus the current payment due for the Revolving Parts of the Account plus any amounts past due from previous Billing Cycles.
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><span class="fBold">Revolving Parts.</span> The current payment due will be the greatest of: (A) $25, or $35.00 if you failed to pay at least the total Minimum Payment Due by the due date in any one or more of the prior six (6) billing cycles; or (B) 3% of the balances on the Account (excluding any balance on a no payments for 6 months (or 9 months or 12 months, as applicable) Purchase and Cash Advance prior to its Expiration Date), on the last day of the Billing Cycle; or (C) 1% of the balance on the Account (excluding any balance on a no payments for 6 months (or 9 months or 12 months, as applicable) Purchase and Cash Advance prior to its Expiration Date), on the last day of the Billing Cycle plus any interest assessed on the Account in that billing cycle (excluding any accrued interest on a Deferred Interest Purchase that has been billed in that billing cycle), plus any Late Fees and Other Fees assessed on the Account in that billing cycle. The payment will be rounded down to the next whole dollar. </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Installment Parts.</span> The Monthly Plan Payment due for each Installment Purchase which has not reached its End Date, and on which a balance is outstanding, will be the installment payment amount you agree to when you make an Installment Purchase. The Monthly Plan Payments for an Installment Purchase will be calculated so that they are substantially equal over the term of the Installment Purchase. In no event, however, will the Monthly Plan Payment due for any Installment Purchase be greater than the outstanding balance due on that part of the Account. The Monthly Plan Payment due on the End Date may be more or less than the others, because it will be adjusted as necessary to pay the actual balance and accrued interest owing on the End Date.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">PAYMENT APPLICATION.</span> We will use each payment in the amount of the Minimum Payment Due or less, first to pay billed Monthly Plan Payments on the Installment Purchases (in any order we choose), then billed interest, then billed Fees, then the principal balance (in any order we choose), and then any other amounts due. However, if you have a balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, during the two Billing Cycles immediately preceding the Expiration Date, we may use the payment first to pay the balance on any Deferred Interest Purchases, (in any order we choose).</li>
<li><span class="fBold">PREPAYMENT.</span> If you pay an amount greater than the Minimum Payment Due in any Billing Cycle, the amount in excess of the Minimum Payment Due is a "prepayment." <u>A prepayment does not change your obligation to make the Minimum Payment Due the next billing cycle</u>. <span class="fBold">YOU MAY MAKE PREPAYMENTS IN ANY AMOUNT AND MAY PAY THE ENTIRE BALANCE OR ANY PART OF IT AT ANY TIME PROVIDED THAT YOU PAY AT LEAST THE MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE IN EACH BILLING CYCLE WHEN IT IS DUE.</span> If you make a prepayment, we will use the prepayment to pay the balances starting with the balance with the highest interest rate (in any order we choose), then the balances with the next highest interest rate (in any order we choose), and so forth. However, if you have a balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, and you make a prepayment during the two Billing Cycles immediately preceding the Expiration Date, we will use the prepayment first to pay the balance on the Deferred Interest Purchase, starting with the balance subject to the highest interest rate. We may choose to apply prepayments to the Deferred Interest Balance before other balances.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">BILLING STATEMENTS AND CREDIT BALANCES.</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
            <p>We will provide you with a billing statement for each Billing Cycle in which:</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(i</span>) We impose interest to this Account; or</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(ii)</span> The New Balance is more than $1.00 (whether a credit or debit balance).</p>
            <p><span class="fBold">(iii)</span> You understand that we may provide you with electronic billing statements only and that you can elect to receive paper statements by logging in to <a href="https://www.billmelater.com" target="_blank">www.billmelater.com</a>.</p>

You agree to examine the billing statement and to notify us in writing, immediately, of any Purchases which were not made or authorized by you. We need not provide a billing statement to you if we deem this Account uncollectible or if delinquency collection proceedings have been started.</p>
        </li>
        <li> If the Account has a credit balance in excess of $1.00, we will refund the credit balance to you as required by law. You authorize us to make the refund electronically or using an ACH, (i) if you made the payment which caused the credit balance electronically or using an ACH, or (ii) if you typically make payments on this Account electronically or using an ACH. In the event that you maintain an account with PayPal, Inc., you authorize us to refund any applicable credit balance directly to your PayPal, Inc. account.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">DEFAULT.</span> You will be in default if any of the following happen:
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If you fail to pay any Minimum Payment Due on or before the Payment Due Date.</li>
        <li>If you fail to keep any promise or perform any duty in this Agreement, or in any other loan or agreement with us. If default occurs, we will have no duty to extend credit from this Account and this Account may be terminated. We may refuse to make any new extensions of credit and may cancel any approved extensions of credit from the Account for any Purchase or transaction that has not yet appeared on a billing statement sent to you. This may happen without any prior notice to you. If we choose, at our sole option, to make new loans from this Account after default, you agree that we may charge those loans to this Account. In addition, if a default occurs, all amounts which you owe under this Agreement shall be due and payable immediately, at our option (subject to any applicable law to the contrary). The other provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply to this Account. If we get a judgment after default and/or if you are a debtor in an action filed by or against you under the Bankruptcy Code, unless prohibited by applicable law, the rates of interest applicable to this Account will continue to apply to the balances on this Account. A default under this Agreement may be deemed by us to be a default under any other account or loan which you have with us.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">TERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNT.</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>In addition to Termination by default, we may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason subject to the requirements of applicable law.</li>
        <li>We can terminate your Account by sending written notice to the address on the billing statement.</li>
        <li>If there is no debit or credit on this Account for twelve (12) consecutive months, we may terminate this Account without notice to you. </li>
        <li>After Termination, you will not be able to make new Purchases on this Account. Termination will not affect any Purchase which complies with this Agreement and which was made before the date of the Termination notice. If we choose, at our sole option, to allow Purchases after we have terminated this Account (whether or not you have given us notice to terminate this Account), you agree that we may charge those Purchases to this Account. After Termination under this paragraph, balances will continue to accrue interest until paid in full and you agree to pay the balance on this Account, the interest and all other amounts due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All other provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply.</li>

<li><span class="fBold">GOVERNING LAW, FORUM.</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><span class="fBold">Governing Law.</span> This Agreement has been accepted by us in the state of Utah, and all extensions of credit will be made by us in the state of Utah. Regardless of the state of your residence or the place where the Merchant is located, you agree that the provisions of this Agreement relating to interest, charges and fees shall be governed by federal law and construed in accordance with federal law and, as made applicable by federal law, the law of the state of Utah. Other terms and provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the state of Utah, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except to the extent preempted, superseded, or supplemented by federal law.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Forum for Disputes.</span> Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate in Section 27 below is found not to apply to you or to a dispute either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or by court order, you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against us must be resolved by a court located in Utah. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Utah for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. Please read this provision carefully. It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how legal claims you and we have against each other are resolved if you do not opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><span class="fBold">Summary.</span> Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling us at (866) 528-3733. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve any Claims (as defined below) you may have to your satisfaction (or if we have not been able to resolve a Claim we have with you after attempting to do so) after following the procedures set forth in this provision, we and you each agree to resolve those Claims through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. <span class="fBold">Any arbitration under this Agreement to Arbitrate will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and non-individualized injunctive relief are not permitted. By agreeing to arbitrate, both parties are waiving the right to a trial by jury or before a judge.</span> For any non-frivolous Claim with a value of $75,000 or less, we will pay all of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees charged by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") in connection with the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration, you are entitled to recover attorney's fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Claims Subject to Arbitration.</span> We and you (including users, custodians, and beneficiaries of your Account) agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims between you and us ("Claims"), including claims involving Bill Me Later, Inc. and its or the Lender's agents, employees, officers, directors, predecessors in interest, and successors and assigns. This Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. Claims include, but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>claims or disputes arising out of or relating to your Account, the Account Agreement, or any transactions involving your Account or the Account Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;</li>
                <li>claims or disputes that arose before the effective date of the Account Agreement or any prior Account Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising, promotions, or disclosures); and</li>
                <li>claims or disputes that may arise after the termination of the Agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            The Account Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et. seq., governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate. The Agreement to Arbitrate shall survive the closing of your Account and/or the termination of the Account Agreement.

        </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Notice of Dispute.</span> A party who intends to pursue a Claim must first send to the other a letter describing the Claim (a "Notice of Dispute"). Any Notice of Dispute sent to the Lender and/or Bill Me Later, Inc. should be addressed to:<br>
            <br>
            Bill Me Later, Inc.<br>
            9690 Deereco Road, Suite 110<br>
            Timonium, Maryland 21093<br>
            ATTN: Legal Department<br>
            <br>
            Any Notice of Dispute sent to you by us shall be sent to the address in the Lender's records that is associated with your Account at the time the Notice of Dispute is sent. The Notice of Dispute must (a) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; (b) set forth the specific relief sought; (c) set forth the name and address of the claimant; and (d) include the Account number to which the Claim relates. If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim described in the Notice of Dispute within 45 days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or, if the AAA is unavailable, such other arbitration provider to which the parties agree or the court selects. Neither you nor we shall disclose to the arbitrator the existence, amount, or terms of any settlement offers made by any party until after the arbitrator issues a final award resolving the Claim. <br>
            <br>
            A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's web site at http:/www.adr.org. If you or we attempt to commence arbitration proceedings before providing the requisite Notice of Dispute, the AAA shall not commence administration of arbitration proceedings for at least 45 days after the AAA receives the request to initiate arbitration.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Costs of Arbitration.</span> Except as otherwise provided herein, we will pay all of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees charged by the AAA for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in your Claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously paid by us, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you or we initiate an arbitration proceeding in which the value of the relief sought (either to you or to us) is greater than $75,000, the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA rules.<br>
            <br>
            After we receive notice that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless the value of the relief sought is greater than $75,000. The maximum filing fee to be paid by you is currently $125 for Claims up to $10,000 and $375 for Claims over $10,000 and up to $75,000. However, these fees are subject to change at the discretion of the AAA. If you are unable to pay your share of the filing fee, we will pay it directly to the AAA upon receiving a written request from you at the notice address provided above. </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Arbitration Procedures.</span> The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the notice address provided above.<br>
            <br>
            The arbitrator is bound by the terms of the Account Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the arbitrability of Claims or the scope and enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, including the interpretation of Section 27(f) below, are for the court to decide. If the value (either to you or us) of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. Otherwise, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any in-person arbitration hearing will take place within the federal judicial district where the address associated with your Account as identified in the Lender's records at the time the arbitration is commenced is located or, if that location is inconvenient to you, at some other location that the parties agree is convenient.
            <br><br>
            The arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with all applicable law, including recognized principles of equity and statutes of limitations, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. Under this Agreement to Arbitrate, arbitrators shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different customers, but are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same customer to the extent required by applicable law.
            <br><br>
            Unless the parties agree otherwise, you or we, as applicable, must bring all related or similar Claims in a single arbitration proceeding. If you or we later initiate a subsequent arbitration asserting Claims that are related or similar to ones that were raised in a prior arbitration between the same parties, the AAA or the arbitrator shall either: (i) consolidate the subsequent arbitration with the earlier proceeding if it is ongoing or (ii) dismiss the Claims raised in the subsequent arbitration that would be barred by applicable law if brought in court.
            <br><br>
            Upon the request of either party made prior to the closing of the hearing (or, if there is no oral hearing, prior to or along with submission of final documents to the AAA), the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award, if any, is based. Unless the parties agree otherwise, any award shall be rendered by the arbitrator not later than 14 days from the date of the closing of the hearing or, if there is no oral hearing, from the date of the AAA's transmittal of the final statements and proofs to the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</span> The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual Claim; any declaratory or injunctive relief must be individualized in nature and cannot affect other Account holders. <span class="fBold">YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC</span>. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than this prohibition of class or representative actions and/or consolidation) is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. However, if a court decides that this paragraph's prohibition of class or representative actions and/or consolidation is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Availability of Small Claims Court and Access to Government Agencies.</span> Notwithstanding the foregoing, we or you may bring an individual action in small claims court. This Agreement to Arbitrate does not preclude us or you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.</li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Opt-Out Procedure.</span> You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate ("opt-out") by mailing us a written opt-out notice. The written opt-out notice must state that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate and must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date that you agree to the Account Agreement for the first time. The opt-out notice must include your name, address, and Account number(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the written opt-out notice for it to be effective. Mail the opt-out notice to:<br>

            Timonium, MD 21094<br>
            ATTN: Arbitration Opt-Out<br>
            This procedure is the only way you can opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the Account Agreement will continue to apply to your Account. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. </li>
        <li><span class="fBold">Future Changes to the Agreement to Arbitrate.</span> Notwithstanding any provision in the Account Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any future change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to any notice address, website link, or telephone number provided herein), that change shall not apply to any Claim of which we had written notice on the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate the Agreement to Arbitrate as included in the Account Agreement, any such termination shall not be effective until at least 30 days after written notice of such termination is provided to you, and shall not be effective as to Claims which arose prior to the date of termination.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="fBold">SEVERABILITY.</span> Except as otherwise provided herein, if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.</li>
<li><span class="fBold">BORROWER'S BILLING RIGHTS - KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE.</span><br>
    Credit Card Purchases means Purchases and Cash Advances made with this Account. This notice is required by federal law. In this notice, "you" and "your" mean the Borrower.

    <p><span class="fBold">What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement</span></p>
    <p>If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:</p>
    <p>PCM Preferred Account, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094.</p>
    <p>In your letter, give us the following information:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">Account information: </span>Your name and account number.</li>
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">Dollar amount: </span>The dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">Description of problem: </span>If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You must contact us:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.</li>
        <li>At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us or email us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.</p>
    <p>What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter</p>
    <p>When we receive your letter, we must do two things:</p>
    <p>1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.</p>
    <p>2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
        While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.</li>
        <li>The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.</li>
        <li>While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.</li>
        <li>We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">If we made a mistake:</span> You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.</li>
        <li><span style="font-style:italic">If we do not believe there was a mistake:</span> You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.</p>
    <p>If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.</p>
    <p>Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases</p>
    <p>If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.</p>
    <p>To use this right, all of the following must be true:</p>
    <p>1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)</p>
    <p>2. You must have used your credit card for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.</p>
    <p>3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase.</p>
    <p>If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at:</p>
    <p>Bill Me Later, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094</p>
    <p>While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.</p>

                <p>We pride ourselves on a tradition of outstanding customer care and support. Our devoted team of account representatives understands that our customers are the hallmark of our enduring partnerships. It is important for our customers to understand the standards that have been established within our industry regarding the terms and conditions of a sale. The purchase of technology products and solutions are subject to manufacturer restrictions which may be different from other product purchases you transact. Most of the products and solutions we sell are subject to a manufacturer's warranty. The warranty provided by the manufacturer is the first place to look for assistance with difficulties that may accompany your purchase. To obtain information regarding manufacturer's warranties, please refer to the website below, contact us at the following e-mail address, or call us:</p>
                <p>1-800-700-1000</p>

                <p>We encourage you to request information from any of our account executives about extending the service period on any of the products or solutions that you purchase.</p>
                <p>Most manufacturers offer a one year warranty on all new equipment. During the warranty period, you may call the manufacturer to receive warranty service.

During the warranty period, you may call 1-800-275-2273 to receive warranty service. Apple will attempt to solve your problem via phone. If they are unable to solve the problem, they will either dispatch a replacement via Airborne Express or will direct you to the closest Apple service center. In most cases, contacting the 800 number is the most expedient manner to obtain warranty service on Apple equipment. If a situation extends beyond Apple or an Apple service center's ability to resolve, please contact your sales representative for further guidance.</p>
                <p>No returns or refunds will be made for items that are special ordered for you or for unusual custom configurations of systems.</p>
